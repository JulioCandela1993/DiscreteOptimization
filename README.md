# Discrete Optimization - the University of Melbourne

Solve complex optimization problems with Discrete Optimization concepts and algorithms:

* Dynamic Programming
* Branch and Bound
* Constraint Programming
* Local Search
* Linear Programming
* Mixed Integer Programming
* Advanced Ensemble models: Combine MIP and Local Search

The use of each algorithm clearly will depend on the magnitude of the problem. Some of them will require an heuristic approach as Local Search or even the combination of many techniques

Some of the solutions can still be improved for the big testsets.

## KNAPSACK PROBLEM

Solution: Branch and Bound

## GRAPH COLORING

Solution: Local Search

## TRAVELING SALESMAN

Solution: Local Search

## FACILITY LOCATION

Solution: MIP

## VEHICLE ROUTING
